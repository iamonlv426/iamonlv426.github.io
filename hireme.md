I am available as a writer for hire on an hourly basis or for fixed-term projects. If you need help creating engaging copy that really pops for a website, blog, brochure, or report I can help. I am a writer with nearly fifteen years of experience in all manner of formats including press releases, press kits, pitch letters, professional biographies, blog posts, articles, reviews, and tutorials.

For the past ten years I've written almost exclusively about technology for PCWorld. My work includes daily news stories, news analysis, company profiles, how-to tutorials, software reviews, and deal alerts. I cover consumer technology products and how to use them, but I also have working knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Markdown, and a general  understanding of JavaScript, Python, and Bash scripting. 

Beyond technology, I hold a Master of Music from Indiana University and have a deep understanding of classical music, and the industry around it. 

Please note that for ethical reasons I cannot accept short-term writing assignments from consumer technology companies. If you are looking for a long term exclusive relationship, however, I am open to discussions.

##My Experience

Writing has always been a big part of my life, but the basis of my career began in public relations in 2006. During this time I honed my skills for writing clear, precise, and factual copy that always presented my clients in their best light. 

Writing became a full-time profession a few short years later with my now decade-long tenure as a freelance journalist with PCWorld, and its sister sites TechHive, Macworld, and Greenbot. I've covered hundreds of stories for these sites concerning the major technology companies including Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. I've done news analysis and reporting on tech legislation, and I've reported on local Israeli companies such as Waze, Soluto, and Zuta Labs.

Throughout 2016, I was the resident Windows expert for About.com, which later became Lifewire.com. I wrote numerous tutorials for the site to help novice Windows users take full advantage of their PCs.

Between August 2015 and February 2016 I also contributed to Yahoo Tech before that arm of the company downsized. For Yahoo, I reported on a variety of technology topics such as the emergence of Internet access in Cuba and [the true value of the fitness brand craze](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/every-step-you-take-raising-1353154060542006.html).

In 2009, I was invited to contribute to the [Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-ftc-blogging-regulati_b_311851.html). Around that same time I also worked on a contract basis for Ebsco Publishing. I wrote numerous research-intensive articles for the company's online encyclopedia targeted at American high schools and colleges. Topics for the Ebsco encyclopedia included political issues such as NAFTA and Medicare, country profiles, biographies of world leaders, as well as opinion pieces for rhetorical study.
