       <h2 class="post p-name">The Daily</h2>
<p class="meta dt-published">06 Feb 2011</p>

<div class="post h-entry">
<p><i><strong>The Daily is a traditional newspaper, TV newscast and gossip rag rolled into one attractive iPad application. Rupert Murdoch’s latest experiment to reboot journalism for the 21st century is now five issues old. How’s it going so far?</i></strong></p>

<p>Here are a few first impressions of The Daily that I’m throwing out there after spending the last five days reading this paper. It’s been interesting, but I can’t shake the feeling there’s something artificial about the first iPad-only newspaper.</p>

<h2>The Text</h2>

<p>The Daily is an easy read. Its stories are short and to the point. But that also means The Daily’s news stories are a shallower take on the news compared to a newspaper like The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. But if you’re just looking for a quick digest that digs a little deeper than the headline–but not much deeper–The Daily is a reasonable choice.</p>

<h2>The Video</h2>

<p>I really appreciate what The Daily is trying to do with its video and audio segments. These are sometimes embedded into larger text stories and sometimes stand on their own. The video segments feel like a mini-TV newscast inside a newspaper. They are much more engaging and have a better production value than what you might see on The News York Times Website. But their depth is also equivalent to what you get in The Daily’s text. The Times videos, by comparison, are more akin to a reporter’s notebook giving you insights you typically don’t see in an actual Times news story.</p>

<h2>The App</h2>

<p>You could get your own impressions on everything I’ve said if you just visit this Tumblr site, which is indexing every single news story published online by The Daily. But what about that app?</p>

<p>When I first tried The Daily I was really disappointed, because the app was extremely crash happy. On The Daily’s launch day, for example, I had problems just trying to open the lead news story. That problem has cleared up considerably, although The Daily still likes to crash on me at least once a day if not multiple times. I also find that it’s really slow to respond to page swipes. This may simply be the fact that the iPad is a first-generation product, and The Daily’s heavy use of media is taxing Apple’s tablet hardware to the limit. But unlike a PC, the iPad doesn’t try to soldier on under the strain of heavy memory usage. Instead, the iPad deliberately crashes the app to return to a more normal state. It’s annoying to be sure, but it may also be the best thing for the overall health of your device.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I like how The Daily takes advantage of the iPad’s landscape and portrait views. For stories with accompanying slideshows you turn the app to landscape to see the images and then portrait to read the story. I suppose it could be seen as gimmicky, but it also reflects how people typically prefer to read versus how images are viewed on the iPad. As for the 360-degree images The Daily publishes every day…zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. The only one I have found even remotely interesting was of Cairo’s Tahrir square after a day of street battles between the pro- and anti-Mubarak camps.</p>

<h2>Yeah, it’s an island</h2>

<p>The Daily’s editorial team took great pains on Wednesday to say that The Daily was not an island. They said you would be able to share stories with friends via Facebook, Twitter and e-mail, and leave comments on individual stories as if it were a blog That’s all true, but at the same time I can’t help but feel isolated when I read The Daily. I am stuck in a disconnected app when I read the paper and you can feel it. I don’t have that same sensation when I read The Times on the iPad. Maybe that’s because the Times has an accompanying Website, maybe that’s because the Times has a larger readership, I’m not sure. As I said, these are first impressions that I’m just throwing out there.</p>

<h2>The Schedule</h2>

<p>Lots of people on Twitter have been making comments about The Daily’s once-a-day publishing schedule. “Yesterday’s news today on my iPad” is a common refrain. At first, I thought these comments were a little unfair, and to a certain degree I still do, but there’s no denying the fact The Daily prints old news by today’s standards.</p>

<p>The continuing unrest in Egypt has made The Daily’s publishing formula appear woefully dated. Since I live in Tel Aviv, I have been obsessed and fascinated with what’s going on in Egypt–a country just a few hours drive from my front door. I tend to watch the day’s events unfold as they happen via Al Jazeera English’s Webcast. Then an hour or two later I can read news from Bloomberg, Reuters, The New York Times and others for a little deeper understanding about what I saw on AJE a few hours earlier. It’s a news junkie’s heaven.</p>

<p>But when I read The Daily the next day it didn’t really have any new information to offer me. I still read it, but almost everything I looked at was old hat. The only exception was a story about events inside Tahrir square. The story reported on several men arrested by the anti-Mubarak protesters who were apparently secret police trying to infiltrate the protests. That was a good story, and I was glad to read it.</p>

<p>The Daily also guides you through its publication programmatically just like you’d see in a physical newspaper or magazine. You start in news, move on to gossip, then opinion, arts and so on. That is entirely artificial and doesn’t take advantage of the fluid nature of digital technology where you start at one point but can end up anywhere through the magic of the link. Other iPad apps also do something similar to The Daily including Project magazine, Vanity Fair and The Economist to name a few. But I am not convinced it’s the best way to organize digital media.</p>

<p>I wonder if The Daily won’t be forced to adopt a strategy closer to what other news organizations are doing online: present the news as it happens and provide deeper coverage and opinion a few hours later. This is a model that appears to be successful on the Web and in mobile apps. I have a feeling The Daily will have to go down this road too. That doesn’t mean The Daily can’t charge for access to its product, but I am guessing this once-a-day publishing schedule won’t last.</p>

<p>Then again, I could be biased since this product isn’t really designed for me. I am a freelancer working from home, and I don’t have a 30-45 minute commute to get to work these days. When I did have a commute, I was always desperate for something to read on the 40-minute trip from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Often I would turn to free papers such as Metro or AM New York and occasionally The New York Times if I felt the news cycle warranted it. Maybe if that was my lifestyle today I would be excited to read The Daily during my commute. I can’t say for sure. But from where I’m sitting now, The Daily will probably have to change its game plan to compete in a world where printing yesterday’s news today is a severe handicap.</p>
