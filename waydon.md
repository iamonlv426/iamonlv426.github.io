Waydon lies in the center of the Saskatchewan plains surrounded by a desert of sky, soil, and swaying wheat.  The only way to know where you are is to see the town name on the grain elevator towering above it, a constant reminder of the town's purpose.  

Few trees exist in this vast expanse and those that do are normally by design--a guard against the unforgiving winds that roll across the land.  The plains can burn you to a crisp under the unforgiving summer sun as winds carrying no relief streak across the land like a blast from a giant furnace.  In the winter, the burnt grass surrenders to hard, crunching snow, and the wind switches from blasting heat to icy cold.
