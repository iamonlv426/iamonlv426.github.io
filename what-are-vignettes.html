I enjoy writing stories. I always have. I've accumlated tens of thousands of words in recent years. Some of it good, some of it terrible, some of it incomplete, and some of it worth printing. That's what this section of my site is all about. 

From time to time I'll drop a short passage from one of my stories in here. I hope you enjoy them.
