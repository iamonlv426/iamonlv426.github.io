I enjoy writing fiction. The thing is I'm really, really bad at finishing a story. Sometimes I get bored, sometimes I lose track, sometimes I get busy...more often than not I just stop. Still, I've got all these words so I might as well do something with them. That's what this section of my site is all about. 

From time to time I'll drop a short passage from an incomplete story in here. I hope you enjoy them.
