I enjoy writing fiction. I've written thousands of words of it in my lifetime. The thing is I'm really, really bad at finishing a story. Sometimes I get bored, sometimes I lose track, sometimes I get busy...the point is more often than not I just stop. Still, I've got all these words so I might as well do something with it. That's what this section is all about. 

From time to time I'll drop a story a short outtake from a story I've written. I hope you enjoy them.
